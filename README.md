# Simple Cinematic Pan

A simple Foundry VTT module that lets the GM synchronize all players' views with their own to create cinematic moments. 

With two main actions â€” Synchronize View, which instantly aligns all player views to the GMâ€™s using smooth canvas animations, and Toggle Canvas Lock, which restores player control â€” you can craft cinematic scenes effortlessly, with no need for complex dialogs or complicated settings. 

The module also offers optional cinematic bars for that movie-theater feel, UI hiding for a more immersive experience, and seamless integration into Foundry's scene controls â€” with easy-to-use macro scripts.

### For the GM

#### Method 1: Scene Controls Interface
The module adds a cinematic controls layer to Foundry's scene controls:

1. **Main Layer Button**: Click the camera icon (ðŸŽ¥) in the scene controls layers
2. **Tool Panel**: A panel of tools will appear with the following options:
   
   - **ðŸ”’ Toggle Canvas Lock**: Lock/unlock canvas for all players
   - **ðŸ”„ Synchronize View**: Synchronize all players' view with yours (automatically locks canvas for all players if not already locked)
   - **ðŸ”„ Reset and resync all users**: Reset view and resync all players

#### Method 2: Macros
You can create custom macros using the module's API methods:

```javascript

// Synchronize current view with default animation duration
cinematicPan.syncView();

// Synchronize current view with a set animation duration in ms
cinematicPan.syncView(5000);

// Toggle canvas lock
cinematicPan.setCanvasLock(true); // or false

// Reset and resync all users
cinematicPan.resetAndResyncAllUsers();
```

### For players

Players don't need to do anything! Their view will be automatically synchronized when the GM uses the module. If the "Hide UI for players" setting is enabled, their interface will be hidden during cinematic mode.

## Settings

The module offers several configurable settings:

- **Cinematic bars opacity**: OpacitÃ© des barres cinÃ©matiques (0 - 1)
